# Wallpaper Engine - Project Verum Rex
<p align=center>
This is a custom Wallpaper Engine Live Wallpaper, Inspired By Kingdom Hearts III, Verum Rex, and Final Fantasy Versus XIII.
I've been wanting to make this wallpaper for a while. Reason this is posted on my Github is due to it containing potenial copyrighted
material that may get flagged on the Steam Workshop.
